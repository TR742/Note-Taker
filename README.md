## About the Project

Note-Taker is an application that allows the user to create new notes to store on the browser using Express.js. Using the starter code provided, I created routes to load each html page, as well as when the user saved a new note. When a new note is saved, it has a unique id attached to it.

## Built With

* Express.js
